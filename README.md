# DiBs Contract Integration Guide and requirements for Uniswap V2 Style Decentralized Exchanges

To integrate Dibs into a Uniswap V2 style decentralized exchange, you need to fulfill certain requirements for each of the following contracts, which are typically included in a Uniswap V2 DEX:

- Router
- PairFactory

For the Dibs system to function properly, meet the following requirements for each contract:

## Router

The router must have the following views:

- `factory`, which points to the PairFactory contract
- `getAmountsOut(uint amountIn, route[] memory routes) public view returns (uint[] memory amounts)`, which, given a swap route, returns all amountOuts. Note that the "route" struct is defined as follows: `{address from; address to; bool stable;}`
- `weth()/wETH()`, which points to the wrapped native token of the chain. Please note that a ChainLink price feed for the native token like wETH on ethereum or wFTM on fantom must be available on the chain.

Additionally, the router contract must emit Swap events with the following data:

- `event Swap(address indexed sender, uint256 amount0In, address tokenIn, address indexed to, bool stable, uint256 feeAmount);`

where "feeAmount" is the total fees generated by the swap. Afterward, you should transfer `feeAmount * MAX_DIBS_FEE_PERCENTAGE` to the Dibs contract.

If you want to enable features such as rewards based on referrals for a specific pair, you must also include the route in the event:

- `event Swap(address indexed sender, uint amount0In, address _tokenIn, address indexed to, bool stable, uint256 feeAmount, route[] routes);`

## PairFactory

The PairFactory contract must emit a PairCreated event whenever a new pair is created:

- `event PairCreated(address indexed token0, address indexed token1, bool stable, address pair, uint256);`
